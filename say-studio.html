              <div class="list-2">Say Studio was a content management platform that supported the app SAY. Before I joined the Radiant team, the front-end developer had been developing the concept of Say Studio. 
              However, the Creative Team team needed a simple user experience that would allow them to create packs, add posts, and schedule posts for automatic publishing. Radiant understood how crucial the user experience was and hired me to take charge of their efforts.  </div>

              <div class="list-2">I started this project by first having thorough conversation with the team about what exactly what our goals and vision were, how to we would achieve them, and most importantly understand what our users expected. I believe it is important to fully understand what the product is before diving in.</div>

              <div class="h5">The Current Experience</div>
              <div class="list-2">Our process started with a live walkthrough to understand the current functionality and experience of Say Studio. We noticed the flow had usability problems that made it challenging for users to achieve tasks quickly and accurately. We also identified visually the user interface was distracting which made it difficult to focus on specific features. Below are are some major usability issues we found:</div>

              <div class="h4">Add Pack and Post</div>  
              <div class="ux-design"> One the major usability issues we came across was adding a pack or post. As you can see on the left, I sketched out the user flow to understand where to proceed.   </div>
              
              <div class="h4">Edit Pack and Post</div> 
              <div class="ux-design"> Another task flow that was repetitive was editing a pack and post. A user had to go through two pages just to edit their pack or post. </div>
              
              <div class="h4">Messaging States</div> 
              <div class="ux-design">There was no way of knowing if your pack or post had been successfully published. Another similar case scenario was if the image size was incorrect, there would be no error message until the pack was submitted. Also observed there were no loading or hover states, which could cause a user to press a CTA several times and duplicate packs or posts. </div>

              <div class="ux-design">At the top, the user has the option to see the badges in a list or grid view. The grid view was difficult to skim through because some of the badge's names where longer and not fully displayed. As for the list view, the artist name at the top right corner made the badge box crowded.</div>
              
              <div class="h4">Typography White Noise</div> 
              <div class="ux-design">Due to the excessive all-caps, bold/light fonts the text hierarchy was not clear which made the content difficult to read.</div>
              
              <div class="h4">Button Inconsistencies</div> 
              <div class="ux-design"> All the button styles are arounded, except on a few screens there were random rectangular gradients that acted as a button.</div>

After sketching out The first iteration of Say Studio was completed within a week I demostrated a walkthrough with the team using Sketch. with the team Since a second map was added, the developers were confused by how the user interacts with two maps now. I made sure the user flow was correct by creating a rough draft using pins and string. After establishing how the user interacts with two maps, I created the overall app's user flow and sent those over to the developers for clarification.</div>
