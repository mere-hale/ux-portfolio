              <div class="list-2">Magpie is a scavenger hunt app that allows users to find and collect digital badges as they explore landmarks. To collect a badge, users are provided with educational material on the site and must complete a quiz about the landmark. Whats the catch? When the user completes a collection, a prize from a local business will be rewarded.</div>
               <div class="list-2">I joined the Magpie team after its first test case sponsored by Spokane Arts. However, the app was not ready for launch due to user experience and design gaps that the product owner was unsure about. My first approach was to go through the app to understand the product and its users.</div>

             <div class="h6">User Experience Issues</div>
              <div class="h4">Filter Bar</div>  
              <div class="ux-design">The filter bar disappears after the user has selected desired filter, if they want to select a different filter they have to go back which seems repetitive.</div>
              
              <div class="h4">QR Scanner</div> 
              <div class="ux-design">Having easy access to the QR Scanner, anyone could take a picture of the QR code and later let other people scan it later to archive the digital badge. This basically defeats the purpose of the app.</div>
              
              <div class="h4">Time Out Screen</div> 
              <div class="ux-design"> The header and bottom toolbar are still visible, the user could easily exit and not have to wait.</div>

              <div class="ux-design">At the top, the user has the option to see the badges in a list or grid view. The grid view was difficult to skim through because some of the badge's names where longer and not fully displayed. As for the list view, the artist name at the top right corner made the badge box crowded.</div>
              
              <div class="h4">Typography White Noise</div> 
              <div class="ux-design">Due to the excessive all-caps, bold/light fonts the text hierarchy was not clear which made the content difficult to read.</div>

              <div class="ux-design"> All the button styles are arounded, except on a few screens there were random rectangular gradients that acted as a button.</div>

              <div class="list-2">While going through the application identifying current issues. I kept in mind who the users were and came accross new painpoints and user experience issues. I addressed these to the product owner: 
                  <div class="question">Why does the map only show current hunt?</div>
                  <div class="question">Why can't the user see an overview of their collections?</div> 
                  <div class="question">Would it make more sense to have search in the filter bar?</div> 
                  <div class="question">Why does the current hunt display unachived badges? That defeats the whole point of a "scavenger hunt".</div>

              <div class="h5">Sketching</div>
              <div class="list-2">After addressing the initial analysis data to the product owner, my next step was to sketch out solutions. Below is a overview sketch of how the user interacts with the map now having the option to see their collections (zoomed out to see the general area) and then zoom in to their current hunt. I also simplified the filter bar and grid/list view issue that was mentioned earlier, which can also see be seen below for more details.</div>

              <div class="h4">Search and Filter</div> 
              <div class="ux-design"> Replacing the grid view with search was ideal because the user could easily search for a collection or badge and then use the filter if necessary.</div>

              <div class="h4">List View Only</div> 
              <div class="ux-design">It made more sense to get rid of the grid view because it was difficult to skim through. For list view there were three concepts on how the badge box's layout should look. Option three ended up being the final design because some badge names could be longer than others. </div>

              <div class="h4">View Collections and Current Hunt</div> 
              <div class="ux-design">I mention the maps last because the origianl idea was to have the binoculars represent "you are here" and when the user taps that icon, it would zoom in to their current hunt/location. Or the user could use the zoom in and out buttons to see the overall area of where their collections were.</div>

              <div class="list-2">However, the product owner thought visually it would be easier to have two separate maps, one for currents hunts and second map would be to see the overall map for collections. Below is an image of how she visualized the user interacting with the toolbar. </div>

              <div class="list-2">Since a second map was added, the developers were confused by how the user interacts with two maps now. I made sure the user flow was correct by creating a rough draft using pins and string. After establishing how the user interacts with two maps, I created the overall app's user flow and sent those over to the developers for clarification.</div>

After creating the wireframes and rapid prototyping, magpie went through it's second usability test. Our feedback was that users were confused by why there were two maps and thought it was irratating how they had to switch between two different maps.</div>
