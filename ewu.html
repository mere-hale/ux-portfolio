              <div class="list-2">As a student myself I understood the frustration of not being able to accomplish much on the app. Instead of assuming what students would like to see, I took the initiative to interveiw other students. Doing so I treated the interview as a converstation to understand what their goals and needs were and uncover painpoints.

            <div class="list-2">The difference between both of these users is Bonnie is a freshman and is not sure what she wants to major in so class times and days don't matter to her. Versus Kyle who is a junior and believes a schedule planner would help him figure what classes he needs to take in order to graduate on time.

              <div class="list-2">I had already established that a bottom toolbar would be the best type of navigation. This would include the dashboard, academic calendar, campus maps, and notfications. Since the timeline was three months my main focus was to create the My EWU Portal Dashboard. Before sketching out what the My EWU Portal Dashboard should look like, I first created a user flow of how the student would interact with the dashboard.

However there are still other features I would like to add to this application in the future. I hope to design confirmation and declined pop screens and establish how students would get notifications for important dates. </div>
